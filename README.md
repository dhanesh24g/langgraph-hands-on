## 📚 Sections Overview

### 🔹 Section 01: Intro to LangGraph

Get familiar with core LangGraph constructs: nodes, edges, and conditional routing.

* `Agent_01_SingleNodeGraph.ipynb`: Minimal example with a single processing node.
* `Agent_02_SequentialGraph.ipynb`: Linear sequence of tasks using node chaining.
* `Agent_03_ConditionalGraph.ipynb`: Branching logic using conditional flows.
* `Agent_04_LoopingGraph.ipynb`: Implement loops and iterative reasoning over LangGraph.

### 🤖 Section 02: Building AI Agents

Progressively build intelligent agents using LangGraph with memory, tools, and ReAct patterns.

* `Agent_01_SimpleBot.py`: Stateless bot using basic prompt logic.
* `Agent_02_MemoryChatBot.py`: Memory-enabled chatbot using LangGraph.
* `Agent_03_ReActAgent.py`: Reasoning + acting agent with multi-step execution.
* `Agent_04_EmailDrafter.py`: Tool-using agent to draft custom emails.
* `Agent_02_ChatLog.txt`: Sample conversation log for agent memory testing.
